# Simple-Multiple-Regression-in-Python

### 01 LR Introduction (Theory)
  - Linear relationship between Input and Output

### 02 OLS, Simple & Multiple Regression (Theory)
  - Simple : One Independent Variable
  - Multiple : More than One Independent Variables
  - OLS :
    - Ordinary Least Square
    - Sum of all [(Acutal - Observed)^2] = Total Error
  - Steps to build Regression Model
    1. Select all variable
    2. Stepwise Regression - Backward & Forward
    3. Model Score comparision
      
### 03 Regression Assumptions (Theory)
  1. Linearity : X linear to Y
  2. Constant Error Variance : Homoscedacity
  3. Independent Error Term : Auto Correlation
  4. Normal Error : Normal distribution of Error
  5. No multicollinearity : Independent X variables
  6. Exogenity : Omitted Variance Bias

### 04 Residual Plot (Theory)
  - Plot of Error

### 05 Homoscedasticity & Hetroscedasticity (Theory)
  - Homoscedasticity : Same Variance 
  - Hetroscedasticity : Different Variance

### 06 Covariance & Correlation (Theory)
  - Covariance : Direction of a relationship between variables
  - Correlation : Strength & Direction of a relationship between variables

### 07 Correlation & Causation (Theory)

### 08 Collinearity (Theory)
  - Why colliearity a Problem ?
  - Check Collinearity
  - Multi collinearity
  
### 09 Auto Correlation (Theory)
  - Similarity between observations as a function of time lag between them 

### 10 VIF (Theory)
  - Detects multicollinearity in Regression

### 11 Regression Assumptions in Python (Code)
  - Step by steps checking Regression Assumptions

### 12 Metrics in Regression (Theory)
  - Asses Model Performance
    1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    2. Mean Square Error (MSE)
    3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
    4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
    5. Mean Percentage Error (MPE)
    6. R Square

### 13 Sum of Square & Adjusted R Square (Theory)

### 14 R, R Square & Adjusted R Square (Theory)

### 15 Regression Output Explained Part 1 (Theory)

### 16 Regression Output Explained Part 2 (Theory)

### 17 Simple & Multiple Regression in Python (Code)
  - Step by step code of Simple & Multiple Regression

### 18 Interview Questions: Simple & Multiple (Theory)
